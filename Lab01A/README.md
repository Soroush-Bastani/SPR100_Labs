## Folder Structure
SPR101_Lab01/├── README.md # This file├── documents/ # Documentation folder├── images/ # Image assets folder
└── code/ # Code examples folder
## Reflection
1. Instructions were to download Git for Windows (Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win). Upon downloading from this source, Seneca's lab computer antiviruse flagged it. Solution: Install it from the Seneca Apps.
2. Git ignores empty folders. So it was not possible to push code/documents/images folder without creating a blank file in them first. Hence I pushed then removed and pushed again.
3. In the beginning we created a test.txt. In the final part of the instructions it's mentioned that "The folder structure in your GitHub repository should be like this:
SPR100_Labs/
├── Lab01A/
│ ├── readme.md
│ ├── documents/
│ ├── images/
│ └── code/
└── [... Other lab folders, if any]

This could be confusing because test.txt is missing. I hope you find these helpul and not a "git" comment!
